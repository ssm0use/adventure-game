[game_intro]
You've been searching for work for weeks when you spotted a flyer at the general store: "FARM HELP WANTED - Room and Board Included. Good pay for hard workers. Ask for directions at Miller's Dairy Farm." The paper was yellowed and curling at the edges, but the address was clear enough. Now, as your car rattles down the long dirt driveway, you're starting to wonder if this was such a good idea after all.
[END]

[farmhouse_arrival]
The gravel crunches under your tires as you pull up to the old Victorian farmhouse. The structure looms against the twilight sky, its white paint peeling in long strips. The porch sags slightly, and fog creeps across the yard despite it being mid-afternoon. Through a window, you catch a glimpse of movement - someone's definitely home. The job posting said to come right to the house.
[END]

[farmhouse_meet_farmer]
The door swings open before you can knock, revealing a weathered man in his fifties. His face is lined with worry, and dark circles shadow his eyes. "You're here about the job?" he asks, hope flickering across his features. "Thank God. I'm Farmer Miller. I... I really need the help." He ushers you inside and lowers his voice. "I'll be honest with you - this farm is cursed. Has been for generations. Strange things happen here. Workers change... become something else. I can't get a lick of work done until it's broken." He wrings his hands. "I know that sounds crazy, but if you're willing to help break the curse, I'll make it worth your while. Good pay, room and board, all of it." He leans in closer. "There's a journal - belonged to my ancestor Ezekiel Miller. It holds the key to understanding what happened here and how to undo it. I lost track of it years ago, but I'm pretty sure it ended up in the old root cellar near the barn. The entrance is hidden, overgrown with weeds and such, but it's there. Find that journal, and we'll have a place to start."
[END]

[farmhouse_ghost_encounter]
You follow the chill to a back hallway where the cold is strongest. There, sitting on a dusty shelf, you find the source - a cracked hand mirror, its surface fogged with unnatural frost. The moment you pick it up, your reflection stares back at you wrong. The crack in the glass seems to widen, and a pale hand reaches through from the other side. The mirror shatters in your grip as a translucent figure of a young woman in an old-fashioned dress rises from the shards. Her eyes are sad, infinitely sad, and she reaches toward you with ghostly hands. The temperature plummets. You feel drawn toward her, as if your very essence might slip away from your body and join her in eternal wandering...
[END]

[farmhouse_ghost_success]
You steady yourself, planting your feet firmly on the ground. The chill is overwhelming, but you focus on the warmth of your own heartbeat, your own breath. "Not today," you whisper through chattering teeth. The ghost's expression shifts - the sadness lifts, replaced by something like gratitude. "Thank you," she breathes, her voice barely a whisper. "I was trapped in that wretched mirror for so long." As her form begins to dissolve into warm light, she presses something into your hands - a delicate silk neckerchief, embroidered with the initials "A.M." in faded gold thread. "It was a gift from the man I loved," she murmurs. "Perhaps it will bring you better fortune than it brought me." Her gaze drifts toward the family portraits on the wall - the stern faces of generations of Millers - and for just a moment, you see the resemblance. Then she is gone, and the chill lifts from the farmhouse at last.
[END]

[farmhouse_ghost_failure]
The cold pierces through to your bones. Your fingers feel numb, then translucent. The ghost's sad smile widens as she recognizes a kindred spirit in the making. As your vision blurs, her voice echoes in your mind - not cruel, but sorrowful. "Now you carry the same chill I do," she whispers. "You'll fade like me... unless you find protection. There is an old amulet, a circle of salt bound in silver. It was lost long ago, dropped into the depths where the cattle used to drink." Her form flickers, then retreats deeper into the farmhouse, disappearing through a wall into the back rooms. "Find it before the cold takes you completely."
[END]

[farmhouse_ghost_deeper]
You make your way through the back hallways of the farmhouse, following the faint chill that lingers in the air. Past the pantry and through a narrow corridor, you find her in a small room that must have once been a bedroom. She hovers near the window, staring out at the farm with those sad, luminous eyes. The temperature drops as she notices you, and she turns to face you. This time there's recognition in her gaze - and a desperate hope. She reaches out again with ghostly hands, testing your resolve...
[END]

[farmhouse_ghost_failure_retry]
The cold overwhelms you again, and you feel yourself slipping. The ghost watches you with those mournful eyes as the chill sinks deeper. "Not strong enough," she whispers sadly. "Not yet. But you came back... that takes courage." She retreats to her window, waiting. You stumble back to the warmth of the kitchen, shaken but alive. Perhaps with better preparation, you can face her again.
[END]

[rootcellar_discover]
Poking around the side of the barn, you notice something half-buried in the weeds - the outline of old wooden doors set into the ground at an angle, the kind that leads down to a root cellar. Vines and dirt have nearly swallowed them whole, but you manage to wrench the rusted handles free and haul the doors open, revealing a set of stone steps descending into darkness below.
[END]

[rootcellar_entrance]
The wooden stairs creak ominously as you descend into darkness. The air is cool and smells of earth and old preserves. Your eyes adjust to reveal shelves lined with dusty mason jars and forgotten farm equipment. But there, on a small table illuminated by a shaft of light from a crack in the foundation, you spot something remarkable: an old leather-bound journal.
[END]

[rootcellar_journal]
The journal's pages are brittle with age, but the handwriting is clear. It's dated 1897 and belongs to Ezekiel Miller, an ancestor. As you read, your blood runs cold:

"The curse began with my greed. My daughter, sweet Abigail, fell in love with the farmhand Thomas. But I forbade the union - he had no land, no prospects. In my anger, I consulted with a traveling witch, seeking a charm to make Abigail forget him. The price seemed small: three drops of blood on the scarecrow in the pasture.

But the witch deceived me. The charm did not make Abigail forget - it bound her spirit to this farm forever, neither living nor dead. Thomas fled in horror when she would not follow him. And now she wanders, lonely and cursed, while the farm itself has taken on a malevolent life. Animals transform, workers vanish, and I cannot undo what I have done.

The witch told me, in cruel jest, that only true love freely given - a union blessed on this farm while Abigail watches - can break the curse. But who could fall in love in such a place? I have doomed my family for generations."

The entry ends there. Abigail. The ghost in the farmhouse must be her.
[END]

[barn_locked]
The barn door is sealed with a heavy padlock, rusted but secure. The metal is unnaturally cold to the touch, as if the barn itself rejects visitors. You'll need a key to get inside.

Farmer Miller shuffles up behind you, wringing his hands. "Sorry about that, {playerName}. I lost the key ages ago - haven't been able to get in there myself. If I had to guess, I'd say it ended up somewhere in the garden. Things have a way of turning up in the strawberry patch. The soil there moves on its own sometimes, pushes things to the surface..."
[END]

[barn_entrance]
The barn door swings open with a prolonged creak that echoes in the vast space. The interior is dimmed by dusty windows, and the smell of old hay mingles with something else — something faintly floral, like lavender left to dry for a hundred years. Empty stalls line both sides, and for just a moment you catch a flicker of movement in the far corner — a pale shape, there and gone, like a girl ducking behind a post. The air feels heavy with waiting. High above, the rafters creak, and you notice the top rungs of a wooden ladder poking up behind a wall of hay bales in the back.
[END]

[barn_abigail_hint]
You move toward the flickering shadow between the stalls, but the closer you get, the more it retreats — always just out of reach, always slipping behind the next post. For a heartbeat you see her clearly: a young woman in an old-fashioned dress, her face pale and luminous, her dark eyes wide with a mixture of longing and fear. She presses a translucent finger to her lips, then shakes her head slowly, as if to say "not yet." She seems to be waiting for something — some proof that you understand, that you know her story. Then she's gone, dissolving into the dusty light like morning mist.
[END]

[barn_ghost_talk_success]
You step between the stalls, holding the journal open so she can see it. "Abigail," you say gently. "I know what your father did. I know about the curse." She materializes slowly — not retreating this time, but drifting closer, her spectral eyes fixed on the familiar handwriting. A trembling hand reaches out and brushes the page, and the air fills with the scent of lavender. For the first time, hope flickers across her ghostly features. She points through the barn wall toward the pasture, then places her palm over her heart. The message is clear: the scarecrow in the pasture is the key to breaking the curse.
[END]

[barn_ghost_talk_failure]
You hold out the journal, but your words come out wrong — too loud, too clumsy in the stillness of the barn. Abigail's form flares bright with alarm, her expression shifting from hope to anguish. The temperature plummets. Frost crawls across the stall doors and the hay crackles underfoot. She lets out a wail that echoes through the rafters, and you feel your grip on the living world beginning to slip, the warmth draining from your bones... As the frost recedes, a faint image lingers in the ice on the stall door — the shape of a circle, with something gleaming at its center. Salt. An old amulet, lost somewhere deep where the cattle used to drink.
[END]

[barn_explore]
Searching the barn reveals old farming equipment, cobweb-covered tools, and bales of ancient hay. In one corner, you find a tarnished brass collar with a small bell attached. It looks like it might have belonged to a prize cow once. Despite its age, when you shake it, the bell rings with a surprisingly pure, clear tone.
[END]

[hayloft_discover]
Your keen eyes spot something others might miss - a wooden ladder partially hidden behind some hay bales, leading up to a hayloft. The rungs look sturdy enough to climb.
[END]

[hayloft_entrance]
You climb up into the hayloft, a cozy space beneath the barn's rafters. Afternoon light filters through gaps in the wood, creating striped shadows. This must have been a storage area. Searching through the old hay, you find some items that have been stashed up here - possibly by previous farmhands.
[END]

[milkingstation_entrance]
The milking station is a separate room attached to the barn, lined with mechanical milking equipment from decades past. The machines are silent now, but something has disturbed the dust — wide, cloven hoofprints track across the floor, glowing faintly blue before fading. The air is frigid, and you can hear the sound of heavy breathing, low and bovine, echoing off the tile walls. A chain on one of the stanchions swings slowly back and forth, as if something large just brushed past it.
[END]

[milkingstation_cow_encounter]
A massive spectral cow materializes from behind the milking stanchions — translucent and glowing with an eerie blue light. Its eyes burn red, and ghostly vapor streams from its nostrils, fogging the cold metal of the equipment. It paws the tile floor once, twice, the sound ringing hollow through the room, then lowers its head and charges straight at you! The narrow space between the machines gives you nowhere to run. You have only seconds to brace yourself...
[END]

[milkingstation_cow_success]
You plant your feet wide and clench your fists, every muscle tensed. The spectral cow's charge is like a freezing wind funneled through the narrow room, but you hold firm, refusing to budge. Your determination seems to surprise it — the red fades from its eyes, replaced by something almost gentle. It retreats between the stanchions with a mournful, otherworldly moo, and the milking machines rattle once before falling still.
[END]

[milkingstation_cow_failure]
The impact of the ghost cow hits you like a wall of ice, slamming you back against the milking equipment. Metal clangs and chains rattle as you crash to the tile floor. As you struggle to rise, you feel something terrible beginning — a heaviness in your limbs, a pulling sensation in your spine. Your hands look strange, thicker somehow... But through the ringing in your ears, you hear something — a clear, pure bell tone drifting from somewhere in the barn. It cuts through the pain like a lifeline, steady and bright.
[END]

[pasture_entrance]
The pasture stretches before you, a wide expanse of overgrown grass swaying in a wind you can't quite feel. In the center stands a scarecrow, its burlap face expressionless, arms spread wide on a wooden cross. Something about it makes your skin crawl - the way it seems to track your movement, the way shadows cling to it even in full daylight. Off to one side, the grass grows in a strange perfect circle, darker and lusher than the rest, as though fed by something beneath the soil.
[END]

[pasture_scarecrow_encounter]
As you approach the scarecrow, its head rotates with a dry rustling sound - straw shifting against cloth. The button eyes seem to fix on you with malevolent intelligence. Suddenly, its wooden frame creaks and moves, one arm reaching out toward you. Where it touches your sleeve, you feel your arm go stiff and rigid, like wood replacing flesh...
[END]

[pasture_scarecrow_success]
You wrench your arm away with all your strength, tearing your sleeve but freeing yourself from the scarecrow's touch. The wooden figure freezes, then slumps back into its original position. You stumble backward, panting, watching to make sure it doesn't move again.
[END]

[pasture_scarecrow_failure]
The scarecrow's grip is impossibly strong. Wooden fingers dig into your arm, and you feel the transformation spreading - your skin hardening, your joints stiffening. You try to scream, but your jaw is locked. Straw begins pushing through your pores... As the scarecrow releases you, a warm breeze drifts from the direction of the garden, carrying the scent of freshly blessed straw. Something there might still save you.
[END]

[pasture_ritual_location]
This is the place. The scarecrow stands at the center of what must have been a ritual circle - you can see the faint remnants of symbols carved into the earth around it. According to the journal, this is where Ezekiel Miller made his terrible bargain. If the curse is to be broken, it must be broken here.
[END]

[pasture_perform_ritual]
You stand before the scarecrow, the journal's instructions memorized. You need true love blessed on this farm - but Abigail's spirit and Farmer Miller, both products of the curse, cannot fulfill it themselves. You realize the answer: YOU must bear witness and give blessing. You call out to Abigail's spirit and begin speaking the counter-charm written in the journal's final page - words Ezekiel never had the courage to speak. The air shimmers. The scarecrow begins to burn with cold fire...
[END]

[oldwell_discover]
Your exceptionally sharp eyes catch something most would miss - an area of the pasture where the grass grows in a perfect circle, as if something beneath affects the soil. Investigating, you find old stones half-buried in earth. With some effort, you uncover an old well, long since covered over and forgotten.
[END]

[oldwell_entrance]
The well is dry, its bottom visible twenty feet down. Using an old rope you found nearby, you carefully lower yourself down. At the bottom, you find it's not entirely dry - there's a small hollow carved into the side, and inside it, wrapped in oilcloth, is something that has been hidden here for a very long time.
[END]

[garden_entrance]
The working garden is a riot of growth - perhaps too much growth. Strawberries the size of your fist grow in wild patches, their red fruit almost glowing. Blueberry bushes tower like small trees, heavy with fruit. Everything here is too healthy, too vibrant, as if the curse that haunts the farm has twisted nature itself into overdrive. A narrow path winds through the plants toward a small tool shed at the far end.
[END]

[garden_strawberries]
The strawberry patch is overgrown, the plants tangled together in a green mass. As you push aside leaves the size of dinner plates, you spot something glinting in the soil - a key! It's old and rusted, but the teeth look intact. This might open the padlock on the barn.
[END]

[garden_explore]
Searching carefully through the garden, you find various items among the plants - some useful, some decidedly odd. The soil itself seems to pulse with unnatural vitality. You get the distinct impression that anything left here too long might begin to grow roots.
[END]

[beehive_entrance]
The bee hives sit at the edge of the garden, a row of white boxes humming with insect life. But the sound is wrong - too deep, too resonant, like a choir warming up rather than simple insects. As you approach, you see the bees are larger than normal, their bodies glinting with an iridescent sheen that has nothing to do with nature.
[END]

[beehive_encounter]
The moment you get too close, the hive's humming shifts to an angry roar. A cloud of spectral bees erupts from the entrance - translucent, glowing insects that swirl around you in a maddening cyclone. They don't sting, but where they brush against your skin, you feel a strange tingling, a wrongness. You need to get out of this swarm before their cursed touch changes you!
[END]

[beehive_success]
Your sharp eyes spot the pattern in the swarm's movement - there's a gap, a space where the bees don't fly. You dive through it, rolling on the ground and coming up outside the swarm's range. Behind you, the bees slowly return to their hive, their angry buzzing fading to the normal hum.
[END]

[beehive_failure]
The swarm engulfs you completely. You can't see, can't breathe without inhaling the phantom bees. Their buzzing fills your skull, and you feel yourself shrinking, changing. Your skin prickles as yellow and black stripes begin to form... When the swarm finally thins, you catch a glimpse of something half-buried in the weeds near the hive — an old equipment box. A beekeeper's tools. There might be something in there that could help.
[END]

[beehive_explore]
Carefully keeping your distance from the main hive, you spot an old beekeeper's equipment box half-buried in weeds. Inside, you find a smoke veil - a protective hood with mesh and a small brazier for creating calming smoke. Somehow, despite decades of disuse, it still feels potent, as if blessed against the very curse that plagues this place.
[END]

[game_win]
The counter-charm reaches its crescendo. The scarecrow erupts in spectral flames, burning away like paper. The earth trembles, and you feel something ancient and malevolent being torn from the land. The fog lifts. The sun breaks through clouds for the first time since you arrived.

Abigail's spirit appears before you, but she's changing - becoming solid, gaining color. She gasps her first real breath in over a century and collapses to her knees, weeping. You rush to her side, catching her before she falls, and when your eyes meet, something passes between you - a spark, a recognition, as if your souls have known each other across the long years.

Old Farmer Miller comes running from the house, tears streaming down his weathered cheeks. "The curse... it's broken. After all these generations..." He looks at you holding Abigail and a knowing smile crosses his face. "I always knew it would take someone special, {playerName}."

In the weeks that follow, the farm transforms. The unnatural fog never returns. The animals are real again - warm-blooded and gentle. The garden grows abundantly but naturally. And you and Abigail are inseparable. She teaches you the old ways of the farm, and you teach her about the modern world she missed. Every evening you sit together on the porch, her hand in yours, watching fireflies dance over fields that are finally at peace.

On a golden autumn day, with the maples blazing red and orange along the property line, you and Abigail are married in the pasture - the very spot where the curse began and where you ended it. Old Miller walks Abigail down the aisle, weeping openly with joy, and gives her away with trembling hands and a full heart.

"This farm has waited over a hundred years for happiness," Miller says in his toast, raising a glass of cider. "Now it has a future again. Here's to {playerName} and Abigail - I can't think of two better people to carry it forward."

As the seasons turn, the farmhouse fills with warmth and laughter. Miller, no longer burdened by the curse that haunted his family for generations, finds a new peace in his twilight years - content to bounce grandchildren on his knee and tell them stories by the fire. The dairy thrives. The fields bloom. And on quiet evenings, you and Abigail stand together at the window, looking out over the land that brought you together, ready to start a new generation on Miller's farm.

THE END - THE CURSE IS BROKEN
[END]

[game_over]
The curses have claimed every part of your body. What remains is no longer human — just another twisted creature of Miller's Dairy Farm, another worker who came seeking employment and was never seen again.

The farm continues its dark existence, waiting for the next unfortunate soul to answer the job posting. Perhaps in another timeline, you made different choices...
[END]

[game_over_cow]
The last of your humanity slips away as your spine locks into its new curve. You drop forward onto four heavy hooves, tail swishing behind you. The clothes that once fit a person split and fall away like shed skin. Your mouth opens to scream, but what comes out is a long, mournful moo that echoes across the empty pasture.

By morning you have forgotten your name. By noon you have forgotten what names are. You stand at the fence beside the other cattle, chewing cud in the pale light, and when the next farmhand arrives you watch them with large, dull eyes that hold no recognition -- only a faint, bovine sadness that will fade with the seasons.
[END]

[game_over_bee]
The buzzing is no longer outside you -- it is you. Your body contracts one final, agonizing time, and then you are airborne, wings blurring in a pitch only you can hear. The world explodes into a kaleidoscope of ultraviolet and pollen trails. The ground is impossibly far below, and the farmhouse is a distant mountain.

You find the hive by smell. The others accept you without question -- another worker, another drone, another set of wings serving the colony. Deep inside what was once your mind, a tiny voice screams for a very long time. Then even that goes quiet, replaced by the simple, endless rhythm of gather, return, gather, return.
[END]

[game_over_scarecrow]
Your last breath leaves you with the dry rattle of straw shifting inside a canvas sack. Your arms stiffen outward, locked to the crossbeam that has replaced your spine. The field stretches in every direction, golden and indifferent. A crow lands on your shoulder and cocks its head, studying the button where your eye used to be.

You cannot blink. You cannot sleep. You can only watch as the seasons turn -- the corn growing tall, the harvest, the snow, the thaw -- year after year, a silent sentinel no one remembers was once a person. Sometimes a farmhand passes and tips their hat to you out of habit. You would nod back if you could. You cannot.
[END]

[game_over_ghost]
The last solid thing about you -- a fingertip, a tooth, the faint weight of your own heartbeat -- dissolves into cold light. You drift upward through the ceiling, through the roof, into a sky you can no longer feel. The farm spreads out below you like a painting, beautiful and utterly unreachable.

You haunt the farmhouse now, drifting through walls you once opened with your hands. The living feel you as a chill, a creak in the floorboards, a candle that gutters for no reason. You try to speak but your voice is only wind. You try to touch but your hands pass through everything. The other ghosts of Miller's Farm nod to you in the moonlight. Welcome home, they seem to say. Welcome home.
[END]

[game_over_mouse]
You shrink and shrink until the world is a cathedral of enormous, terrifying things. The floorboards are highways. A breadcrumb is a boulder. Your heart hammers at three hundred beats a minute, and every sound -- a distant footstep, the creak of a beam -- sends you scurrying for the nearest shadow.

You make your nest behind the kitchen wall with shredded newspaper and stolen cotton. At night you creep out to nibble at whatever crumbs the farmhands leave behind. You know there is something you have forgotten -- something vast and important -- but the thought is too big for your tiny skull, and it slips away like water through your small pink paws.
[END]

[game_over_zombie]
The rot finishes what it started. Your last clear thought disintegrates like wet paper, replaced by a single, wordless hunger. Your jaw hangs open. Your arms reach forward. One foot drags behind the other in a lurching shuffle that will never stop and never quicken.

You join the others in the smokehouse -- the previous workers who never left. You stand among them in the dark, swaying gently, waiting for the door to open. When it does, when the next poor soul steps inside looking for cured meat and answers, you will reach for them with bloated fingers. Not out of malice. You don't remember malice. You don't remember anything at all.
[END]

[game_over_spider]
The last of your human skin splits along the back and something dark and glistening pulls itself free. Eight legs unfold where two once stood. Eight eyes blink open in a face that no longer has a name. Silk spools from your abdomen in long, sticky threads, and you begin to climb.

You find your corner in the highest rafter of the barn and begin to spin. The web grows wider each night -- an intricate, terrible architecture that glitters with dew each morning. Flies come. Moths come. Eventually, larger things come. You wrap them carefully, patiently, and wait. The farm has a new spider, and she is very, very patient.
[END]

[smokehouse_entrance]
The smokehouse is a squat stone building, barely taller than you, with a single heavy door and no windows. Inside, the air is thick with the ghost of old smoke -- not real smoke, but a spectral haze that clings to your skin and stings your eyes. Iron hooks dangle from the ceiling like the fingers of some vast, hidden hand. Slabs of something dark hang from a few of them, though you can't tell if it's ancient meat or something worse. The walls are black with decades of soot, and in the far corner, a stone fire pit sits cold and dead. Despite this, the room feels warm -- too warm -- as if a fire burned here moments ago.
[END]

[smokehouse_zombie_encounter]
The haze in the smokehouse thickens without warning, and with it comes a smell -- sweet, cloying, unmistakably rotten. From behind the hanging slabs of ancient meat, a figure lurches into view. It was a farmhand once, someone like you. Now its skin hangs gray and loose, its jaw works up and down with a wet clicking sound, and it shuffles forward with arms outstretched, groaning with a hunger that has nothing to do with food. Its overalls are stained with something you don't want to identify. You need to calm it down, talk it back to whatever rest it came from, before its grasping hands find you...
[END]

[smokehouse_zombie_success]
You hold your ground and speak slowly, clearly, the way you'd talk to a confused old-timer at a county fair. "Hey now. Easy, big fella. Nobody's going to hurt you." The shambling farmhand hesitates, its jaw still working, one milky eye rolling toward your face. Something flickers behind that dead gaze -- recognition, maybe, or the memory of what it felt like to be spoken to kindly. It lets out one last rattling groan, almost sad, and then slumps against the wall, sliding down until it's just a pile of old clothes and dust. The smell lingers. But the danger has passed.
[END]

[smokehouse_zombie_failure]
You gag and stumble backward, but the shambling farmhand is faster than it looks. Its swollen fingers close around your wrist with a grip like a cold ham, and the smell hits you full in the face -- smoke and rot and something sickeningly sweet. Your vision swims. Your stomach lurches. When it finally lets go and shuffles back into the haze, something feels deeply wrong. Your skin looks... grayish. There's a stiffness in your joints that wasn't there before, and you keep groaning involuntarily. This can't be good. But as you stumble out of the smokehouse, a faint scent of sage and old bones drifts from the farmhouse, clean and sharp against the rot. Someone hung a ward in there once. Maybe it's still there.
[END]

[smokehouse_explore]
Behind the fire pit, wedged into a gap between two stones, you find a leather pouch. Inside is strips of jerky, dark and perfectly preserved despite what must be decades of sitting here. You take a tentative bite -- it's incredible. Savory, dense, and warming. Each piece fills you with a stubborn determination, as if the spirit of whoever cured this meat poured their grit into the recipe.
[END]

[cornfield_entrance]
Beyond the pasture fence, the corn begins. It shouldn't be this tall -- the stalks tower well over your head, their leaves rasping against each other in a breeze you can't feel. The rows stretch in every direction, straight at first glance but subtly wrong, curving inward like the walls of a maze. The light dims the moment you step between the first stalks, as if the sun itself is reluctant to follow you in here. Something rustles deeper in the field. It could be wind. It could be an animal. But it moves with a slow, deliberate rhythm that sounds almost like footsteps.
[END]

[cornfield_scarecrow_encounter]
The corn closes in around you as you push deeper. The stalks lean inward, brushing your shoulders, your face. Dry leaves scratch at your skin like wooden fingers. Then you see it -- or rather, them. Scarecrow figures are lashed to posts throughout the field, one at every junction of the rows. Their burlap heads turn to track you, slow and creaking. The corn itself seems to stiffen, stalks going rigid as fence posts, hemming you in. You need to spot the way out before the field decides to keep you here permanently...
[END]

[cornfield_scarecrow_success]
Your sharp eyes catch what others would miss -- a pattern in the scarecrows' positions, a gap in the wall of corn where the stalks are thinner and paler. You bolt for it, ducking under grasping leaves and wooden arms. The field groans around you, stalks cracking and snapping in frustration, but you burst through the thin spot and into a small clearing. The scarecrows sag on their posts behind you, still and lifeless once more.
[END]

[cornfield_scarecrow_failure]
The corn closes like a fist. You can't see the sky, can't see the ground, can't see anything but an endless wall of dry stalks pressing against you from every side. Something rough scrapes across your arms -- not corn leaves, but twine. Your joints lock up, stiffening like green wood drying in the sun. When the stalks finally part again, your arms feel wrong. Heavy. Rigid. You look down and see splinters where skin should be... But the wind shifts, and from the direction of the garden you catch a whisper of warmth — the faint memory of blessed straw, growing somewhere among the living plants.
[END]

[cornfield_explore]
Near the base of one of the scarecrow posts, half-buried in the dark soil between the corn rows, you find a collection of objects. A tarnished brass compass catches your eye first -- its needle spins lazily, ignoring north entirely, pointing instead toward... something. And beside it, tangled in the roots of a corn stalk, is a small doll made of straw and corn husks. It has black button eyes. It stares at you.
[END]

[grainsilo_entrance]
The grain silo rises from the edge of the cornfield like a sentinel tower, its corrugated metal walls streaked with rust and age. The door hangs half-open on broken hinges. Inside, the air is thick with the smell of ancient grain gone to rot -- sweet and cloying, like something fermenting in the dark. The interior is a tall cylinder of shadow. Old grain still fills the bottom third of the silo, a sea of desiccated wheat and barley that shifts and settles with soft, unsettling whispers. Metal rungs climb one wall, leading to a catwalk high above. A cold draft rises from somewhere beneath the floor, carrying a smell older than the grain — stone and damp earth. And somewhere in the grain, something large is breathing.
[END]

[grainsilo_cow_encounter]
The grain erupts. A massive shape surges upward from the desiccated sea -- a spectral bull, bigger than any living animal, its translucent hide rippling with pale blue fire. Unlike the ghost cow in the milking station, this one is no docile creature. Its horns are wide and sharp, its eyes blaze crimson, and it snorts vapor that smells of copper and old blood. It lowers its enormous head and charges through the grain, sending up a wave of rotting kernels. The silo shakes with the force of its hooves. You have to stand your ground or be trampled and changed...
[END]

[grainsilo_cow_success]
You brace yourself, feet planted wide in the shifting grain, and let out a roar of defiance that surprises even you. The bull bears down, a freight train of spectral muscle and cold fire, but you do not flinch. At the last instant, it splits around you like water around a stone, its phantom body passing through the air on either side. You feel the chill of its passage, the thunder of its hooves, but you hold. The bull reforms behind you, shakes its massive head, and sinks back into the grain with a low, grudging bellow.
[END]

[grainsilo_cow_failure]
The bull hits you like a wall of frozen wind. You're lifted off your feet and thrown backward into the grain, which swallows you to the chest. The bull circles back, lowering its horns, and you feel its cursed energy washing over you in waves. Your shoulders broaden painfully, your spine shifts with a sickening crack. When you finally claw your way out of the grain, your hands feel thick and clumsy, and there's a heaviness in your bones that wasn't there before... From somewhere far behind you, carried on the wind from the barn, you hear the pure ring of a brass bell. It makes the pain recede, just for a moment.
[END]

[grainsilo_explore]
Climbing the metal rungs to the catwalk, you find a maintenance platform overlooking the grain below. Someone lived up here once -- there's a bedroll, a tin cup, and scratches on the wall counting days. Hundreds of scratches. Among the meager belongings is a wrought-iron lantern, its glass panes miraculously intact. When you pick it up, a tiny flame flickers to life inside it, warm and steady, casting your shadow in dramatic angles across the silo wall.
[END]

[siloBasement_discover]
Your keen eyes notice something the rust and grain almost hide -- a seam in the metal floor beneath the catwalk, and a recessed handle covered in corroded bolts. Someone sealed this shut on purpose. With effort, you wrench the hatch open, revealing a narrow ladder descending into darkness below the silo's foundation.
[END]

[silobasement_entrance]
The basement beneath the silo is older than the silo itself -- stone walls instead of metal, rough-hewn and sweating with moisture. This was some kind of root storage or perhaps a storm shelter, repurposed and then sealed away. Shelves line the walls, holding jars of something dark and unidentifiable. Thick webs span every corner, glistening with moisture, their silk impossibly fine and strong. Whatever spun them was no ordinary spider.
[END]

[silobasement_explore]
You brush aside the webs and search the shelves. Behind a row of sealed jars, half-hidden by a curtain of silk, you find something delicate and beautiful -- a bracelet woven from spider silk, shimmering faintly in the dim light. It feels warm against your skin, as though it carries a ward against the very creatures that spun it. Someone left this here on purpose, tucked away where only the brave or the desperate would find it.
[END]

[chickencoop_entrance]
The chicken coop leans against the back of the barn like a drunk against a wall, its wood gray and splintering, its wire mesh torn in a dozen places. The door hangs by one hinge. Inside, nesting boxes line the far wall in three crooked rows, stuffed with straw that has gone gray with age. Feathers still drift in the stale air, though no chicken has lived here in decades. The floor is covered in a thick layer of dust and droppings, and in that dust, you can see tracks -- tiny, frantic claw-marks running in circles and figure-eights. Hundreds of them. Whatever lives here now is much smaller than a chicken.
[END]

[chickencoop_mouse_encounter]
The moment you step toward the nesting boxes, the coop comes alive with sound -- a high-pitched chittering that seems to come from everywhere at once. Spectral mice pour from the nesting boxes, the walls, the floor itself -- dozens of translucent rodents with glowing pink eyes and whiskers that crackle with cursed energy. They swirl around your feet, your ankles, climbing higher with every heartbeat. You need to stay calm, keep your composure, speak softly and slowly. Panic will only make them swarm faster...
[END]

[chickencoop_mouse_success]
You take a slow, deliberate breath and let your shoulders drop. "Easy," you murmur, keeping your voice low and musical, the way you might soothe a frightened animal. "Easy now. I'm not here to bother you." The spectral mice slow their frantic circling, whiskers twitching as they consider you. One by one, they release their grip on your clothes and flow back into the nesting boxes like water draining from a tub. The chittering fades to a soft, almost contented hum.
[END]

[chickencoop_mouse_failure]
You flinch. That's all it takes. The mice sense your fear like a spark in dry tinder, and the swarm surges upward -- over your boots, up your legs, across your stomach. Their tiny spectral claws prickle against your skin, and where they touch, you feel yourself shrinking, condensing. Your nose twitches involuntarily. Your ears itch. When the swarm finally retreats, you're on your hands and knees, and your hands look... smaller. The fingernails are darker. More like claws... But from somewhere above -- up in the hayloft of the barn -- you hear a faint, rumbling purr. The mice hear it too, and they freeze. Cats have always kept the mice at bay on this farm.
[END]

[chickencoop_explore]
Searching the nesting boxes carefully, you find the remnants of old eggs, feathers, and mouse droppings. In one box, partially buried, sits a single black egg, cold as stone and heavy for its size. Something shifts inside it when you turn it over. It doesn't feel right. The box is draped in fine, glistening webs -- spider silk, impossibly delicate. You've seen silk like this before only once: down in the sealed basement beneath the grain silo, where the webs are thick as curtains.
[END]

[farmhouse_explore]
You poke around the farmhouse, opening cupboards and peering behind furniture. In the back hallway, above a door frame, you find something odd: a small bundle of animal bones tied together with dried sinew and wrapped in sage leaves. It's hung there deliberately, like a ward. When you take it down, it rattles softly in your hand, and the air around it smells clean and sharp -- the exact opposite of rot. Whatever this is, someone put it here to keep something dead from getting any ideas.
[END]

[farmhouse_farmer_ghost_reaction]
Farmer Miller nearly drops his coffee when you tell him what happened. "You freed her? The ghost in the mirror?" He sits down heavily, running a hand through his thinning hair. "That spirit has haunted this house since before I was born. My grandmother used to say she was a young woman who got trapped by the curse long ago - maybe one of the hired girls from the old days, or..." He pauses, glancing at the family portraits. "Or maybe someone closer to the family than we ever knew. A.M. - those initials on that neckerchief. Could be an Abigail Miller. There's been more than a few of those in this family." He shakes his head in wonder. "Well, the house already feels warmer. Thank you for that. Now, about that journal - any luck finding it yet?"
[END]

[farmhouse_return]
Farmer Miller is at the kitchen table, nursing a fresh cup of coffee. He looks up as you enter. "How's the search going out there? Found anything useful yet?" He glances toward the window, worry creasing his brow. "Be careful - the curse runs deeper than just this house. But I'm glad you're still here. Most folks would've run off by now." As he speaks, you notice a draft of icy air drifting from the back hallway — unnaturally cold, as if something lingers there just out of sight.
[END]

[farmhouse_return_cleared]
Farmer Miller is at the kitchen table, looking a shade more at ease than last time. The back hallway feels warmer now — whatever was lingering there has moved on, at least for the moment. "The house feels a little lighter since you dealt with that spirit," he says, wrapping both hands around his coffee mug. "But don't let your guard down. The curse on this land runs deep — deeper than one ghost. The farm's still not right, and it won't be until the whole thing is broken for good."
[END]

[rootcellar_return]
You descend the creaking stairs back into the root cellar. The air is cool and earthy, the shelves of dusty mason jars undisturbed. The small table sits in its shaft of light, quiet and still.
[END]

[barn_return]
The barn door groans as you push it open again. The smell of old hay and that faint trace of dried lavender greet you. The empty stalls stretch into shadow on either side, and you could swear the dust motes are drifting in a shape — almost like a girl, watching from a distance.
[END]

[hayloft_return]
You climb back up into the hayloft. Afternoon light still filters through the gaps in the wood, striping the old hay with gold. It's quiet up here, almost peaceful.
[END]

[milkingStation_return]
The milking station is just as cold as before. The old machines gleam in the dim light, and those faint cloven hoofprints still glow blue on the tile floor. A chain on one of the stanchions sways gently, though nothing visible has touched it.
[END]

[pasture_return]
The pasture spreads before you again, its overgrown grass swaying in that unfelt wind. The scarecrow stands sentinel in the center, arms spread wide, shadows clinging to its burlap form.
[END]

[oldwell_return]
You lower yourself back down into the dry well. The small hollow in the wall is empty now, but the stones still feel ancient and heavy with purpose.
[END]

[garden_return]
The garden is still a riot of impossible growth. Oversized strawberries glow red among the tangled vines, and blueberry bushes tower like small trees. The air hums with unnatural vitality.
[END]

[beeHives_return]
The bee hives hum with their deep, unsettling chorus. The unnaturally large bees drift between the white boxes, their iridescent bodies glinting in the light. You keep your distance.
[END]

[smokehouse_return]
The smokehouse is just as you left it -- thick with spectral haze, the iron hooks dangling from the ceiling, the stone walls black with soot. The air is warm despite the dead fire pit.
[END]

[cornfield_return]
The corn towers over you as you step between the stalks again. The rows curve inward like a closing fist, and the light dims around you. Something rustles deeper in the field with slow, deliberate rhythm.
[END]

[grainSilo_return]
The grain silo looms above you, rust-streaked and ancient. Inside, the desiccated grain still shifts and whispers in the dark. The smell of rot and fermentation hangs heavy in the air.
[END]

[siloBasement_return]
You descend the narrow ladder back into the stone basement beneath the silo. The sweating walls and unidentifiable jars are unchanged. It's cold and silent down here.
[END]

[chickenCoop_return]
The chicken coop leans and creaks as you step back inside. Feathers drift in the stale air, and the frantic claw-marks in the dust cover the floor in their endless circles and figure-eights. The nesting boxes are quiet -- for now.
[END]

[barn_search_fail]
You move through the barn methodically, checking behind hay bales, peering into empty stalls, running your hands along the rough wooden walls. Dust motes swirl in the pale light, and you catch a faint whiff of lavender -- but nothing reveals itself. The barn has been hiding its secrets for a long time, and it's not ready to give them up just yet.
[END]

[pasture_search_fail]
You pace the overgrown pasture, kicking through the tall grass, searching for anything out of place. The scarecrow watches you from its post, button eyes impassive. The wind shifts the grass in waves, and for a moment you think you see a pattern -- a circle, a depression -- but when you look closer, it's just more tangled weeds. The pasture keeps its secrets buried deep.
[END]

[grainSilo_search_fail]
You circle the interior of the silo, testing the floor with your boot, tapping the corrugated walls for hollow spots. The grain shifts and whispers beneath you, and something about the floor near the catwalk feels wrong -- too solid, too deliberate -- but you can't find a seam or a handle. Whatever's down there, it's well hidden.
[END]
